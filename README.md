# House Price Prediction Model

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on historical data. The model is built using Random Forest, XGBoost, and ensemble methods like Voting Regressor.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the `house_price_prediction.py` script to train the model and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
